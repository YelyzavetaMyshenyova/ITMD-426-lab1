    <h1> My Hobby (sort of) </h1>
   <p> Hi (-: I don't really have much in the way of hobbies, but I do spend a lot of time exploring new coffee shops downtown. I have a huge list that I add to every time I find a new place that looks interesting. I probably go visit a new coffee shop almost every weekend.</p>
    </header>

  <h2> Here's a couple of places that are still on my list: </h1>
  <ul>
    <li> <a href= "https://www.yelp.com/biz/sawada-coffee-chicago"> Sawada Coffee </a> </li>
    <li> <a href= "https://www.yelp.com/biz/jibek-jolu-chicago" >  Jibek-Jolu </a> </li>
    <li> <a href= "https://www.yelp.com/biz/limitless-coffee-and-tea-fulton-market-chicago"> Limitless </a> </li>
  </ul>
     
  <p> I also occasionally visit a new food place that I find interesting. For example, here's a picture from a thai rolled ice cream place in Chinatown that I've visited..... </p>

  <h2> Some information about a couple of the coffeeshops that I've been to in Chicago:</h2>  
  <p> Cafe-Umbria is a little further up north and has really interesting mugs with bright designs, and pretty good coffee (although the seating area is not the best). If you're looking for more of a food place, Shokolad is located in Ukrainian village and is a good Russian food spot. And if you're interested in something a little closer,  Red Line Cafe is always a decent spot is about a 12 minute walk from IIT </p>
