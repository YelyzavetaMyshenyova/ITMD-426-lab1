    <p> Hi (-: I don't really have much in the way of hobbies, but I do spend a lot of time exploring new coffee shops downtown. I have a huge list that I add to every time I find a new place that looks interesting. I probably go visit a new coffee shop almost every weekend.</p>
<p> Here's a couple of pictures from places that I have visited </p>

    <img src= "images/mug_resized.png" alt="mug">
    <p> This is a cute mug from a coffee shop downtown called Caffe Umbria. </p>

    <img src= "images/lemontart.png" alt="lemon tart">
    <p> This lemon tart is from a cafe in Greektown called Artopolis. </p>

    <p> I also went to a rotary sushi bar up north over this last weekend --> </p>
